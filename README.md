# AssemblyBitindexCounter
A low-level project written in Assembly.

This was made for the EFM8 Busy Bee 8-bit microcontroller produced by Silicon Labs.
The program consists of a subroutine, which given the IRAM's cell number (0-255) and the bit's serial number in the cell (0-7), in two registers, outputs the bit index in two registers (0-2047). 

Visual explanation is available in Hungarian.
